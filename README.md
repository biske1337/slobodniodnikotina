# Free from Nicotine README
ðŸš­ Free from Nicotine
My First Real Project | A Journey of Learning & Growth

ðŸŒŸ About This Project
This is my first serious programming projectâ€”a Free from Nicotine app designed to help people quit smoking. As someone who struggled with nicotine addiction, I wanted to build something meaningful while teaching myself Java, Android development, IOS development, Flutter and version control (Git/GitHub).

I started with zero experience, made countless mistakes, and learned through trial and error. This project represents months of self-study, debugging, and small victories.

Key Features

âœ” Progress Tracking â€“ Log smoke-free days and milestones.

âœ” Motivational Quotes â€“ Encouraging messages to stay strong.

âœ” Withdrawal Tips â€“ Helpful advice for managing cravings.

âœ” Simple & Clean UI â€“ Easy to use, even for beginners.

ðŸ›  How I Built It

Languages: Flutter (Visual studio code with Android studio)

Tools: Git, GitHub

Learning Challenges:

Understanding Flutter syntax combined with Android and IOS features

Managing user data with SharedPreferences

Handling Android lifecycle methods

Debugging for hours (e.g "My app crashed for 3 days until I fixed NullPointerException")


ðŸ“– What I Learned

This project taught me:

âœ… Problem-solving â€“ Google and Stack Overflow became my best friends.

âœ… Persistence â€“ Fixing one bug often led to another, but I kept going.

âœ… The joy of small wins â€“ When my first button finally worked, I celebrated!

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Iâ€™d love to add:

A community support feature

Better stats visualization

Notifications for motivation

ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
This isnâ€™t a polished, professional appâ€”itâ€™s my first step into real coding. If youâ€™re learning too, I hope this inspires you to build something, no matter how small!
